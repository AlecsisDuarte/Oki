## Drowsiness prevental application :zzz:

The application notifies the user if he or she is falling asleep behind the wheel using the front 
camera to detect whether the eyes are closing more than usual with a background running service.

If the application detects an unusual eyes blinking it starts making a sound to wake up the user 
and if this happens more times than what the user specified as normal, it makes a phone call 
automatically to the phone saved as emergency in the settings.
